# SAE Client TODO

## Completed Components ‚úÖ

### Core Services
- [x] Key Management Service (`src/services/key_service.py`)
- [x] Storage Service (`src/services/storage_service.py`)
- [x] Authentication Service (`src/api/auth.py`)
- [x] Cryptographic Utilities (`src/utils/crypto.py`)

### Infrastructure
- [x] Configuration Management (`src/config.py`)
- [x] ETSI API Models (`src/models/api_models.py`)
- [x] KME API Client (`src/api/client.py`)
- [x] Notification Service (`src/services/notification_service.py`)
- [x] CLI Interface (`sae_client.py`)
- [x] Setup Script (`setup_sae.sh`)

## Future Enhancements üîÑ

### Testing
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests for all services
- [ ] Integration tests with KME server
- [ ] End-to-end workflow tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Security Enhancements
- [ ] Key encryption at rest (for production use)
- [ ] Certificate pinning
- [ ] Rate limiting for API calls
- [ ] Audit trail improvements

### Features
- [ ] Web-based management interface
- [ ] Key rotation automation
- [ ] Backup and restore functionality
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting

### Documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] User guides
- [ ] Troubleshooting guides
- [ ] ETSI compliance documentation

## Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Dependencies
- OpenSSL dependency in auth service (may need to be optional)
- Some cryptographic operations may need optimization for high-throughput scenarios

### Configuration
- Certificate paths are hardcoded in some places
- Environment-specific configurations may need refinement

### Integration
- KME server integration needs real-world testing
- Network communication protocols may need adjustment

## Notes üìù

- All core functionality is implemented and ready for testing
- The client is designed for laboratory use with unencrypted local storage
- Production deployment would require additional security measures
- Certificate management is currently manual but can be automated
